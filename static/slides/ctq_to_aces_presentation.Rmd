# My (real) problem

It's hard to study childhood maltreatment. To do a better study, I'm using three samples. 

To assess maltreatment, two samples took the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to assess trauma. The other took the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) survey. 

Do these scales correspond?

# Glorious Data

* 462 young adults took both the CTQ and ACE
* Dataset from Martin Teicher

### Thanks, Marty!

# Comparing the questionnaires

.pull-left[
### CTQ
* Five questions per subscale ask about frequency (1 = Never, 5 = Very Often).
* Physical neglect examples:
  1. I didn't have enough to eat.
  2. I knew that there was someone to take care of me and protect me.*
  3. I had to wear dirty clothes.  
  4. My parents were too drunk or high to take care of the family.  
  5. There was someone to take me to the doctor if I needed it.*  

\* Reverse-scored 
]

.pull-right[
### ACE
* Asks one compound question per subscale.
* Physical neglect: "Did you **often** feel that you didn’t have enough to eat, had to wear dirty clothes, and had no one to protect you? -or- Your parents were too drunk or high to take care of you or take you to the doctor if you needed it?"

# Prediction strategies

How well can we predict ACE scores from CTQ scores?
--

### 1. Item-based
* Predict ACE endorsement by being above threshold on one or more subscale items

--

### 2. Subscale-based
* Predict ACE endorsement by being above threshold on a summed subscale score

--

### 3. Logistic regression
* Predict ACE endorsement by being above probability threshold for a logistic regression model
